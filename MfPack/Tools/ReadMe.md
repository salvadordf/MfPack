The application can be used to determine HResult or Error codes returned by the Windows OS,
featuring a detailed build in "HResult Lookup tool", the "Windows System Error Code Lookup Tool" and
the "System.SysUtils.SysErrorMessage" function.
A tool to create a new or translate a new HRESULT using Severety, Facility and Error code is also provided.

You can use procedure RunFxErrLookUpTool in this unit to use the HResult Lookup Tools Application,
located at ../MfPack/Tools.

When you need a version > 6.4.5, that is allready present, copy this tool 
to ../MfPack/Tools/MicrosoftErrorLookupTool and adjust the WIN_ERROR_LOOKUP_TOOL constant in
