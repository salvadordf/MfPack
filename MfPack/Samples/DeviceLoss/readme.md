This example (based on the MfSimpleCapture example) shows, how you how to implement a deviceLoss handler
within your code.

Description

  This sample describes how to detect device loss when using a video capture device.
  It contains the following steps:

    1 Register for device notification.
    2 Get the Symbolic Link of the device.
    3 Implement a messagehandler to handle WM_DEVICECHANGE.
    4 Unregister for notification when you close your app.

Create FDeviceLoss object example:
   FDeviceLoss := TDeviceLoss.Create(Handle, DeviceEnumIndex, dmo_Message);
   Parameters:
   Handle = Application Window handle
   DeviceEnumIndex = The device index that has been picked from the MFEnumDevices activation pointer.
   dmo_Message = When a device is lost, FDeviceLoss sends a message to the Application Window.
   dmo_MessageBox = When a device is lost, FDeviceLoss shows a messagebox.
   dmo_Both = Send message and show messagebox.

Note:
   The Application Window must have a message handler to intercept the WM_DEVICELOST message when
   dmo_Message or dmo_Both are set.
