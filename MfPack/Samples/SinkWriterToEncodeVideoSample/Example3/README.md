# SinkWriterToEncodeVideoSample Sample 3.
Version: X 3.1.6

A VCL-based Delphi-application to encode a series of bitmaps with an audio file to video using the Windows Mediafoundation-API.
The sample shows how to select, arrange and preview bitmap, gif, png or jpeg files that can be added to a mp3 or avi file.


* Thanks to Renate Schaaf for the initiative sample!

Supported file formats and codecs:

Output:  
Presently only .mp4 with H264 or H265(HEVC)-codecs.
Hardware encoding is enabled if supported.
Audio can be encoded to AAC or FLAC.

Input:  
Theoretically anything that Windows has a decoder and encoder for should work as input for audio. 
Exception: Rampling different from the input is not always supported.


Usage:
1- Set the desired video for output (which is currently MP4 only).
2- Select the folder with your imagefiles (Supported are png, gif, jpeg and bitmap files)
3- Select the files that should be added. 
4- Add an audio file if needed.
5- Render the file. 

Delphi-Versions:

Developed under Delphi XE-7.
Supported Delphi versions are XE7 and above. 
Records with methods, anonymous procedures, interposer classes, tasks and TWicImage need to be available.

Runtime Requirement:

To be able to use all encoding features, Windows 10 20H2 or higher is required.
