**AudioClip and AudioClipEx sample**

*Demonstrates using the IMFSourceReader API to extract uncompressed media data from a media file. This sample application reads audio data from a media file and writes the uncompressed audio to a WAVE file.*

*The AudioClipEx sample demonstrates using the IMFSourceReader and IMFSourceReaderCallback API to extract uncompressed mediadata from a media file.*

**MfPlayer**

*Player samples, based on the CPlayer sample.*

*There are 3 samples in 3 project degrees.*

- *MfPlayer I : The basic player sample.*

- *MfPlayer II : The extended version I sample.*

**Ducking Media Player**

  *This sample implements a simple media player that responds to the "ducking"* 
  *feature in Windows 7 and later. It also implements a volume control which tracks*
  *to the volume control in the volume mixer.*

**Simple Player**

*Demonstrates audio/video playback using the IMFPMediaPlayer and IMFPMediaPlayerCallback API.*
*Note: This API is deprecated, but still -partly- functional in Windows 10 version 2004 (May 2020 update).*
       It's not recommemble to use this API, because of many issues concerning playing different formats.

**Ducking Capture Sample**

  *This sample implements a simple "Chat" that demonstrates to the "ducking"* 
  *feature in Windows 7 and later. It simply captures samples from the sound card and* 
  *discards them.*

**MFFrameCapture sample**

*Demonstrates how to capture an image (synchronous or A-synchronous) using the IMFSourceReader.*

![](https://github.com/FactoryXCode/MfPack/blob/Master/MfPack/Pic/MfFrameCapture.png)

**CameraFrameCapture sample**
*Demonstrates how to capture a still image or so called snapshot (A-synchronous) from a* 
*capture device such as a webcam or camera using the IMFSourceReader.*
